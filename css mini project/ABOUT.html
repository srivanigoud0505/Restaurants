        <P>Appetizers are finger foods usually served before a meal, or in between mealtimes, and are also called hors d’oeuvres, antipasti,
             or starters, and may range from the very simple to the very complex, depending on the occasion and the time devoted to making them. They are a 
             common accompaniment to aperitifs, cocktails served before a meal.

            At dinners, banquets and the like, appetizers may be served before a meal. 
            This is especially common at weddings when it takes time for the wedding party and guests to get to a reception after the marriage has taken place. 
            Appetizers may be served at long parties that occur after a regular mealtime. A mid-afternoon party where there is no intent to serve dinner, or an evening party that occurs 
            after dinner may feature appetizers so that guests can have the opportunity to snack.
             Many restaurants feature a range of appetizers that are ordered just before a meal as a first course</P>

            The evolution of Indian food is deeply intertwined with the countrys history and geography. The early Harappan civilization laid the foundation with its farming practices, later enriched by the Aryans’ dairy-based diet. Subsequent invasions, trade relations, and colonial rule introduced new ingredients and cooking methods, shaping the cuisine we know today.

Indias geography has also played a significant role. Coastal regions, with their
 abundant seafood, have developed distinct dishes like Goan fish curry. In contrast, the arid regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat have unique vegetarian cuisines, given the scarcity
 of water and fresh produce.
 Indian cuisine is characterized by its bold use of spices, which are typically toasted and ground into a blend known as masala. These spice blends vary regionally, with garam masala in the north and sambar powder in the south. Herbs, such as coriander, mint, and fenugreek, also play a significant role, adding depth and complexity to dishes.

Rice and wheat are staple grains, forming the base for dishes like biryani and roti.
 Lentils and pulses are also integral, providing protein in a predominantly vegetarian diet. Dairy, in the form of milk, yogurt, and ghee, is used extensively, 
especially in northern India.

            The History of Desserts
            Long ago, desserts were not like they are today. In ancient times, people would eat fruits or nuts with honey as a treat. As time passed, cooking methods improved, and new ingredients like sugar became available. This allowed people to start making more complex and tasty desserts. For example, in the Middle Ages, rich people could afford sugar and began enjoying sweet pastries and other baked goods. 
            Over time, the variety of desserts grew, and now we have countless recipes from all around the world</p>

        <p>Many firms in the beverage industry have integrated Porter’s five forces model into their marketing strategies with the aim to competitively positioning their products and services in the market against rivals firms (Porter 1985). One such typical example is the beverages industry. The beverage industry is a case study which contributes a rich body of knowledge based on Porter’s 
            five forces leading to the successful growth the industry has experienced over the years.
            In this case, this analysis provides an in-depth understanding of how Michael Porter’s five generic forces have influenced how firms in the beverages industry position their products and services in the market and the most appropriate forces an industry should emphasize on to gain an upper hand against competitors, with firms such as Starbucks as a case example.

            According to Ball (2007 p 1), firms dynamically formulate strategies to enable them to gain a strong position in the market, increase the market share to optimize on profits, 
            to gain and sustain strong brand images, and positively influence profits (Argenti 2004; Cummings & Daellenbach 2009). </p>
